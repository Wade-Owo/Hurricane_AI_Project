What inspired this project was a research paper by Dr. Wenqian Dong.
In it she explored the issues with current Hurricane data. The problem is that often, this data is incomplete, inconsistent, or even missing.
To solve this issue she created a framework called HurriCast. 
HurriCast utilizes data augmentation to generates synthetic hurricane tracks to supplement historical data. 
The goal of it is to create new, plausible hurricane scenarios, not to repair old data. 

After reading this I decided to create a AI model that predicts whether there will be a landfall based on a list of independent variables in the [dataset]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/noaa/hurricane-database?select=atlantic.csv)).
In this project I utilized pandas(Python library), numpy(Python Package), mathplotlib(Python Library) & imblearn(Python Library for imbalanced datasets).
Please read the comments in each cell for more detail on my thought process!
